# Toon-Shader-Sonic-Riders
A Toon Shader made in Unity 2021 inspired from the artstyle of the game Sonic Riders.
This shader uses multiple passes, one for the main mesh and two others to draw the shadows and the outlines.
This shader currently supports:
- A single directional light source,
- Independant coloring for the lit and shaded areas of the mesh,
- The ability to use texture maps (normal, gloss, metallic & occlusion),
- Support for skybox & ambient reflection,
- Support for textured & colored shadows, shadow cast/Receive, specular light, rim light & fresnel effect,
- Very flexible shading settings, with each main lighting option (shadows, specular, etc.) able to be independant from the main light source.

This shader is susceptible to future changes.
